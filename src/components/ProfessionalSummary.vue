    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I've been working as a software developer for about five years now, and
      I've really enjoyed diving into both front-end and back-end technologies.
      I have a strong grasp of TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and Django, which
      has allowed me to build some pretty cool web applications. I love crafting
      responsive JavaScript apps that provide a great user experience, and I
      take pride in developing complex back-end systems with Django. Managing
      SQL databases is also part of my toolkit, and I've had hands-on experience
      with deploying applications on platforms like Heroku and AWS. Testing is
      important to me, so I make sure to implement thorough testing strategies
      to ensure everything runs smoothly. Overall, Iâ€™m passionate about creating
      scalable solutions that connect user interfaces with back-end systems
      seamlessly.
